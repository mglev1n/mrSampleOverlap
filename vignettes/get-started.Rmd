# Estimate bias due to sample overlap

This function allows the user to estimate bias due to sample overlap in Mendelian randomization studies using the equations published in Burgess et. al. 2016 (DOI: [10.1002/gepi.21998](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.21998))

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->


<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->


```{r examples-estimate_overlap_bias}
# Binary outcome
estimate_overlap_bias(samplesize_exposure = 361194,
                      samplesize_outcome = 1125328,
                      case_prop = 0.035,
                      rsq_exposure = 0.068,
                      n_variants = 196,
                      ols_bias = 0.2,
                      overlap_prop = 0.3)

# Continuous outcome
estimate_overlap_bias(samplesize_exposure = 361194,
                      samplesize_outcome = 1125328,
                      rsq_exposure = 0.068,
                      n_variants = 196,
                      ols_bias = 0.2,
                      overlap_prop = 0.3)
```

<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.

# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()` 
-->



<!-- 
- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
